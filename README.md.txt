Treatment of Polluted Water by Distillation


1. Description
* This project focuses on improving the quality of polluted water using simple and fractional distillation techniques. 
* The aim is to respond to local environmental issues in a practical way and make water safer for use. 
* Water quality was analyzed by measuring pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, hardness, and identifying heavy metals. 
* This project not only minimized contaminants but also enhanced understanding of analytical chemistry methods.


2.  Objectives
* Improve the quality of polluted water through distillation
*  Analyze water quality before and after treatment
*  Reduce environmental pollution by applying realistic methods
* Learn and apply analytical chemistry techniques to solve real-world problems


3. Methodology
*  Collected polluted water samples
*  Applied simple distillation and fractional distillation procedures
*  Tested water quality using:
*  Titrimetric analysis for pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and hardness
*   Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy for heavy metal detection
*  Compared results before and after distillation to assess improvements


4. Tools and Equipment Used
* Simple and fractional distillation setup
* Titration kits
